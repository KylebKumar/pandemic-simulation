# pandemic-simulation
A simple simulation of an infectious disease that tries to mimic the effects of staying at home during a pandemic

# Running the Simulation
The simulation is best run on the command line because the program takes command line arguments,
but the arguments are optional. The StdDraw.java and Person.java files are both necesary for the
program to run. You can run the program by typing the following into the command line ...

`javac Simulation.java`

`java Simulation <number_of_people> <number_of_sick> <rate_of_infection> <percent_of_people_staying_in_place> <delay_between_frames>`
